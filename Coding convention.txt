#@Coding style and skill:
## Some convention about transfer data:
	1. Flow: Should use DTO object to receiver and send data: 
		- with database: Database->model->service->DTO
		- with api: api -> api client -> DTO -> service -> controller
		- with client: client -> controller -> DTO -> service -> model || api client
